# LLMs are different from trasitional ML because:
# 1. typically pre-trained
# 2. have a huge number of parameters
# 3. require significant computational resources
# 4. can sometimes have unpredictable outcomes
# 
### LLMOps 
# ensures the seamless integration of LLms into organizations
# ensures smooth transition across lifecycle phases, from ideation to deployment
# provide scalable, risk mitigating solutions

##### Lifecycle of LLMs #####
### 1. Ideation Phase
## Data Sourcing: identifying data needs
# is the data relevant?
# is the data available? -> transform data, set up additional databases, evaluate costs, consider limitations
# does the data meet standards?

## Select base model selection
# whether to use propiritry or open-source model
# evaluate model on: 
# 1. performance -> response quality + speed
# 2. characteristics -> data used to train the model
# 3. practical considerations -> type of liscense associated with the model
# 4. important secondary factors -> popularity etc



### 2. Development Phase
# Prompt Engineering
# Chains and Agents
# RAG vs. fine-tuning
# Testing

### 3. Operational Phase
# Deployment
# Monitoring and Observability
# Cost Management
# Implementation of Governance and Security
